      <p class="blog_header">WHAT IS TECHNOLOGY?</p>
      <br><br>       
      <p class="blog_text">
      The application of scientific knowledge (skills, methods, and processes) to the practical aims of human life, anything from the discovery of the wheel all the way up to computers and mp3 players is called technology. It can be incredibly simple or dazzlingly complex. It has a significant impact on how we live, work, and play. They manipulate and change the human environment. They make human life and problem-solving easier. We cannot even imagine a life without technology now.
      </p> 
      <br>
      <p class="blog_text">
      The earliest and simplest form of technology is the development of knowledge that leads to the application of basic tools. The system of practical knowledge and problem solving to create tools is the idea/concept. And the gadgets and gizmos used are the tools. For example: Moving fast is the idea, and the wheel is the tool to move faster.

      <!-- Types of Technology -->
      <p class="blog_text">
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The 3 main types of technology are:</span>
      </p>
      <br>
      <ol class="types_list">

        <li><b>1.) Industrial:  </b></li>
        <br>
        <p>Industrial technology is the application of engineering and manufacturing technology to improve the speed, simplicity, and efficiency of production. Industrial technology employs innovative and technically skilled individuals who can assist a company in achieving efficient and profitable productivity. Optimization theory, human factors, organisational behaviour, industrial processes, industrial planning procedures, computer applications, and report and presentation preparation are common topics covered in industrial technology programmes. The primary responsibility of an industrial technologist is to plan and design manufacturing processes and equipment. An industrial technologist is frequently in charge of putting certain designs and processes into action.<br>E.g.: Electronics, Robotics, industrial machines, etc.</p>
        <!-- IMAGE -->
        <img src="industry.jpg" alt="industry" class="images" width= "100%"; height="auto";>
        <br>

        <li><b>2.) Mechanical:  E.g.: Cars, Oven, Airplanes, Trains, Buses, Rockets, etc.</b></li>
        <br>
        <p>Mechanical technology, which includes wheels, cams, levers, gears, belts, and engines, is the first type. Mechanical objects are those that turn or allow motion in one direction to cause another type of motion. The wheel is one of the most important technological advances in human history, despite its simplicity.<br>E.g.: Cars, Oven, Airplanes, Trains, Buses, Rockets, etc.</p>
        <!-- IMAGE -->
        <img src="mechanical.jpg" alt="mechanical" class="images" width= "100%"; height="auto";>
        <br>

        <li><b>3.) Medical: E.g.: X-rays, Ultrasound, ECG, etc.</b></li>
        <br>
        <p>One of the most important types of technology is medical technology. It includes medical science machinery and services that are powered by technology. Medical technologies include instruments for disease analysis, pain-relieving devices, and medications for treating and curing diseases. All of these things help to protect us from dangerous viruses and bacteria, extending our lives. The following are some examples of medical technology equipment. <br>E.g.: X-rays, Ultrasound, ECG, etc.</p>

      <p class="blog_header">CURRENT STATUS OF TECHNOLOGY</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="blog_text">
      The current state of technology is at its peak. The use of technology has never been in this amount. We cannot even imagine a life without technology now because everything is done online. People nowadays donâ€™t have to go to school. If they want to study from their home, many schools have online education facilities. You can work from home. People make money from social media like YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. People now can make a career out of the internet. Everyone has a phone of their own. Even a 4, 5 years old baby cannot survive without a phone in their hands.
      </p>
      <br>
      <!-- Technologies popular now. -->
      <p class="blog_text">
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">As technology is at its peak, there are many awesome new technologies available today. Some of them are listed below:</span>
      </p>
      <br>
      <ol class="types_list">

        <li><b>1.) Artificial Intelligence</b></li>
        <br>
        <p>While AI has been around for a while, it is now having an exponentially growing impact on the development of our society, economy, and military. It is evolving and being deployed at such a rapid pace that we can see it changing the way we live and interact.</p>
        <p>AI investments by corporations and businesses of all sizes reached new heights in 2021, exceeding all previous expectations and predictions. In 2020, international corporate investment in artificial intelligence is expected to reach nearly 68 billion USD. The most visible advancement in AI use is seen in how we interact with voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. Many other companies and entities are working on AI for driverless cars, but none have reached the point where their technology can truly replace drivers.</p>
        <!-- IMAGE -->
        <img src="ai.png" alt="AI" class="images" width= "100%"; height="auto";>    
        <br>

        <li><b>2.) 3D printing</b></li>
        <br>
        <p>3D printing is an additive process that involves building up layers of material to create a 3D part. This is the inverse of subtractive manufacturing processes, which involve cutting a final design from a larger block of material. As a result, 3D printing wastes less material.</p>
        <br>
        <!-- IMAGE -->
        <img src="3d.png" alt="3D" class="images" width= "100%"; height="auto";> 
        <!-- ADVANTAGES OF 3D PRINTING -->
        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Advantages of 3D printing:</span></p>
        <br>
        <li>1.) Bespoke, cost-effective creation of complex geometries:</li> 
        <br>
        <p>This technology enables the simple creation of bespoke geometric parts with no additional complexity. Because no extra material is used, 3D printing can be less expensive than subtractive manufacturing methods in some cases.</p>
        <br>
        <li>2.) Affordable start-up costs:</li>
        <br>
        <p>The costs associated with this manufacturing process are relatively low because no moulds are required. The cost of a part is proportional to the amount of material used, the time required to construct the part, and any post-processing that may be required.</p>
        <br>
        <li>3.) Completely customisable:</li>
        <br>
        <p>Because the process is based on computer-aided designs (CAD), any product changes are simple to implement without affecting manufacturing costs.</p>
        <br>
        <li>4.) Ideal for rapid prototyping:</li>
        <br>
        <p>Because the technology allows for small batches and in-house production, this process is ideal for prototyping, as products can be created faster than with more traditional manufacturing techniques and without reliance on external supply chains.</p>
        <br>
        <li>5.) Allows for the creation of parts with specific properties:</li>
        <br>
        <p>Although plastics and metals are the most commonly used materials in 3D printing, there is also the possibility of producing parts from specially tailored materials with desired properties. For example, parts with high heat resistance, water repellency, or higher strengths can be created for specific applications.</p>
        <br>

        <li><b>3.) Brain-Computer Interfaces</b></li> 
        <br>
        <p>Brain-computer interfaces allow humans to control machines with their minds. The technology is still in its early stages, but the possibilities are endless. It could, for example, help paralysed people regain control of their limbs and allow servicemembers to operate a drone hands-free on the battlefield.</p>
        <p>However, establishing a direct link between the brain and the machine may raise concerns. It could, for example, provide users with unfair advantages by enhancing physical and cognitive abilities. Hackers could also steal information about a person's brain signals.</p>
        <!-- IMAGE -->
        <img src="brain.png" alt="Brain" class="images" width= "100%"; height="auto";> 
        <br>

        <li><b>4.) Self-driving vehicles</b></li>
        <br>
        <p>A self-driving car (also known as an autonomous car or driverless car) is a vehicle that travels between destinations without the assistance of a human operator by utilising sensors, cameras, radar, and artificial intelligence (AI). To be considered fully autonomous, a vehicle must be able to navigate to a predetermined destination without human intervention on roads that have not been modified for its use.</p>
        <p>Audi, BMW, Ford, Google, General Motors, Tesla, Volkswagen, and Volvo are among the companies developing and/or testing self-driving cars. Google's test involved a fleet of self-driving cars navigating over 140,000 miles of California streets and highways, including Toyota Prii and an Audi TT.</p>
        <p>In theory, if autonomous cars dominated the roads, traffic would flow more smoothly and there would be less congestion. The occupants of fully automated cars could perform productive tasks while commuting to work. People who are unable to drive due to physical limitations may gain new independence through autonomous vehicles and be able to work in fields that require driving.</p>

        <li><b>5.) Robotics</b></li>
        <br>
        <p>Robotics is an engineering discipline that deals with the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. The goal of robotics is to develop intelligent machines that can assist humans in a variety of ways. Robotics can take many different forms. A robot can be human-like or take the form of a robotic application, such as robotic process automation (RPA), which mimics how humans interact with software to perform repetitive, rules-based tasks.</p>
        <br>

        <img src="robotics.png" alt="Robotics" class="images" width= "100%"; height="auto";> 

        <li><b>6.) Big Data and Analysis</b></li>
        <br>
        <p>Big data analytics is the often complex process of examining large amounts of data in order to uncover information â€“ such as hidden patterns, correlations, market trends, and customer preferences â€“ that can assist organisations in making informed business decisions.</p>
        <p>Data analytics technologies and techniques, on a broad scale, enable organisations to analyse data sets and gather new information. BI queries provide answers to basic questions about business operations and performance.</p>
        <p>Big data analytics is a type of advanced analytics that involves complex applications powered by analytics systems that include elements such as predictive models, statistical algorithms, and what-if analysis.</p>
        <p>Big data analytics systems and software can help organisations make data-driven decisions that improve business outcomes. Benefits may include improved marketing effectiveness, new revenue opportunities, customer personalization, and operational efficiency. These advantages, when combined with an effective strategy, can provide a competitive advantage over competitors.</p>

        <li><b>7.) 5G networks</b></li>
        <br>
        <p>Fifth-generation wireless (5G) is the most recent iteration of cellular technology, designed to significantly improve the speed and responsiveness of wireless networks. Data transmitted over wireless broadband connections can now travel at multigigabit speeds, with some estimates putting peak speeds as high as 20 gigabits per second (Gbps). These speeds are faster than wireline network speeds and have latency of less than 5 milliseconds (ms), which is useful for applications that require real-time feedback. Because of increased available bandwidth and advanced antenna technology, 5G will enable a significant increase in the amount of data transmitted over wireless systems.</p>
        <br>
        <!-- IMAGE -->
        <img src="5g.png" alt="5G" class="images" width= "100%"; height="auto";> 

        <li><b>8.) Cloud Services</b></li>
        <br>
        <p>The term "cloud services" refers to a broad category that includes the numerous IT resources available via the Internet. The term can also refer to professional services that help with the selection, deployment, and ongoing management of various cloud-based resources.</p>
        <p>The first definition of cloud services encompasses a wide range of resources that a service provider delivers to customers via the internet, which has become widely known as the cloud in this context.Self-provisioning and elasticity are features of cloud services; that is, customers can provision services on-demand and shut them down when they are no longer required. Furthermore, rather than paying upfront for software licences and supporting server and network infrastructure, customers typically subscribe to cloud services, for example, through a monthly billing arrangement. This approach makes cloud-based technology an operational expense rather than a capital expense in many transactions. Cloud-based technology, from a management standpoint, allows organisations to access software, storage, compute, and other IT infrastructure elements without the burden of maintaining and upgrading them.</p>
